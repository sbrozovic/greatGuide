# TheGreatGuide
 
TheGreatGuide application is designed to show the life of Nikola Tesla through cities that were important in his life.
Every city has a series of locations connected to Nikola Tesla. A location can be his house, university he has been in, hotel he stayed at or just a location with his statue.
Every location has its story, a series of images and/or videos.
This application is mainly designed for tourists that come to a certain city and want to see places connected to Nikola Tesla.
